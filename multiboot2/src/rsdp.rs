//! Module for RSDP/ACPI. RSDP (Root System Description Pointer) is a data structure used in the
//! ACPI programming interface.
//!
//! The tag that the bootloader passes will depend on the ACPI version the hardware supports.
//! For ACPI Version 1.0, a `RsdpV1Tag` will be provided, which can be accessed from
//! `BootInformation` using the `rsdp_v1_tag` function. For subsequent versions of ACPI, a
//! `RsdpV2Tag` will be provided, which can be accessed with `rsdp_v2_tag`.
//!
//! Even though the bootloader should give the address of the real RSDP/XSDT, the checksum and
//! signature should be manually verified.
