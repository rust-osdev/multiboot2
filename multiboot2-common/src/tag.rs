/// implementation.

/// Implementors **must** use `#[repr(C)]`. As there might be padding necessary
/// for the proper Rust layout, `size_of_val(&self)` might report additional
/// padding bytes that are not reflected by the actual payload. These additional
/// padding bytes however will be reflected in corresponding [`BytesRef`]
/// instances.
