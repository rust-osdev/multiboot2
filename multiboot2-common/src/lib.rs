//! Common helpers for the `multiboot2` and `multiboot2-header` crates.
//!
//! # Value-add
//!
//! The main value-add of this crate is to abstract away the parsing and
//! construction of Multiboot2 structures. This is more complex as it may sound
//! at first due to the difficulties listed below. Further, functionality for
//! the iteration of tags are provided.
//!
//! The abstractions provided by this crate serve as the base to work with the
//! following structures in interaction:
//! - multiboot2:
//!   - boot information
//!   - boot information header (the fixed sized begin portion of a boot
//!     information)
//!   - boot information tags
//!   - boot information tag header (the fixed sized begin portion of a tag)
//! - multiboot2-header:
//!   - header
//!   - header header (the fixed sized begin portion of a header)
//!   - header tags
//!   - header tag header (the fixed sized begin portion of a tag)
//!
//! # TL;DR: Specific Example
//!
//! To name a specific example, the `multiboot2` crate just needs the following
//! types:
//!
//! - `BootInformationHeader` implementing [`Header`]
//! - `BootInformation` wrapping [`DynSizedStructure`]
//! - `type TagIter<'a> = multiboot2_common::TagIter<'a, TagHeader>`
//!   ([`TagIter`])
//! - `TagHeader` implementing [`Header`]
//! - Structs for each tag, each implementing [`MaybeDynSized`]
//!
//! Then, all the magic using the [`TagIter`] and [`DynSizedStructure::cast`]
//! can easily be utilized.
//!
//! The same correspondingly applies to the structures in `multiboot2-header`.
//!
//! # Design, Solved Problem, and Difficulties along the Way
//!
//! Firstly, the design choice to have ABI-compatible rusty types in
//! `multiboot2` and `multiboot2-header` mainly influenced the requirements and
//! difficulties along the way. These obstacles on the other side, influenced
//! the design. The outcome is what we perceive as the optimal rusty and
//! convenient solution.
//!
//! ## Architecture Diagrams
//!
//! The figures in the [README](https://crates.io/crates/multiboot2-common)
//! (currently not embeddable in lib.rs unfortunately) provides an overview of
//! the parsing of Multiboot2 structures and how the definitions from this
//! crate are used.
//!
//! Note that although the diagrams seem complex, most logic is in
//! `multiboot2-common`. For downstream users, the usage is quite simple.
//!
//! ## Multiboot2 Structures
//!
//! Multiboot2 structures are a consecutive chunk of bytes in memory. They use
//! the "header pattern", which means a fixed size and known [`Header`] type
//! indicates the total size of the structure. This is roughly translated to the
//! following rusty base type:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[repr(C, align(8))]
//! struct DynStructure {
//!     header: MyHeader,
//!     payload: [u8]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that these structures can also be nested. So for example, the
//! Multiboot2 boot information contains Multiboot2 tags, and the Multiboot2
//! header contains Multiboot2 header tags - both are itself **dynamically
//! sized** structures. This means, you can know the size (and amount of
//! elements) **only at runtime!**
//!
//! A final `[u8]` field in the structs is the most rusty way to model this.
//! However, this makes the type a Dynamically Sized Type (DST). To create
//! references to these types from a byte slice, one needs fat pointers. They
//! are a language feature currently not constructable with stable Rust.
//! Luckily, we can utilize [`ptr_meta`].
//!
//! Figure 1 in the [README](https://crates.io/crates/multiboot2-common)
//! (currently not embeddable in lib.rs unfortunately) provides an overview of
//! Multiboot2 structures.
//!
//! ## Dynamic and Sized Structs in Rust
//!
//! Note that we also have structures (tags) in Multiboot2 that looks like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[repr(C, align(8))]
//! struct DynStructure {
//!     header: MyHeader,
//!     // Not just [`u8`]
//!     payload: [SomeType]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! or
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[repr(C, align(8))]
//! struct CommandLineTag {
//!     header: TagHeader,
//!     start: u32,
//!     end: u32,
//!     // More than just the base header before the dynamic portion
//!     data: [u8]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Chosen Design
//!
//! The overall common abstractions needed to solve the problems mentioned in
//! this section are also mainly influenced by the fact that the `multiboot2`
//! and `multiboot2-header` crates use a **zero-copy** design by parsing
//! the corresponding raw bytes with **ABI-compatible types** owning all their
//! memory.
//!
//! Further, by having ABI-compatible types that fully represent the reality, we
//! can use the same type for parsing **and** for construction, as modelled in
//! the following simplified example:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! /// ABI-compatible tag for parsing.
//! #[repr(C)]
//! pub struct MemoryMapTag {
//!     header: TagHeader,
//!     entry_size: u32,
//!     entry_version: u32,
//!     areas: [MemoryArea],
//! }
//!
//! impl MemoryMapTag {
//!     // We can also create an ABI-compatible structure of that type.
//!     pub fn new(areas: &[MemoryArea]) -> Box<Self> {
//!         // omitted
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Hence, the structures can also be build at runtime. This is what we
//! consider **idiomatic and rusty**.
//!
//! ## Creating Fat Pointers with [`ptr_meta`]
//!
//! Fat pointers are a language feature and the base for references to
//! dynamically sized types, such as `&str`, `&[T]`, `dyn T` or
//! `&DynamicallySizedStruct`.
//!
//! Currently, they can't be created using the standard library, but
//! [`ptr_meta`] can be utilized.
//!
//! To create fat pointers with [`ptr_meta`], each tag needs a `Metadata` type
//! which is either `usize` (for DSTs) or `()`. A trait is needed to abstract
//! above sized or unsized types. This is done by [`MaybeDynSized`].
//!
//! ## Multiboot2 Requirements
//!
//! All tags must be 8-byte aligned. The actual payload of tags may be followed
//! by padding zeroes to fill the gap until the next alignment boundary, if
//! necessary. These zeroes are not reflected in the tag's size, but for Rust,
//! must be reflected in the type's memory allocation.
//!
//! ## Rustc Requirements
//!
//! The required allocation space that Rust uses for types is a multiple of the
//! alignment. This means that if we cast between byte slices and specific
//! types, Rust doesn't just see the "trimmed down actual payload" defined by
//! struct members, but also any necessary, but hidden, padding bytes. If we
//! don't guarantee the correct is not the case, for example we cast the bytes
//! from a `&[u8; 15]` to an 8-byte aligned struct, Miri will complain as it
//! expects `&[u8; 16]`.
//!
//! See <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html> for information.
//!
//! Further, this also means that we can't cast references to smaller structs
//! to bigger ones. Also, once we construct a `Box` on the heap and construct
//! it using the [`new_boxed`] helper, we must ensure that the default
//! [`Layout`] for the underlying type equals the one we manually used for the
//! allocation.
//!
//! ## Parsing and Casting
//!
//! The general idea of parsing is that the lifetime of the original byte slice
//! propagates through to references of target types.
//!
//! First, we need byte slices which are guaranteed to be aligned and are a
//! multiple of the alignment. We have [`BytesRef`] for that. With that, we can
//! create a [`DynSizedStructure`]. This is a rusty type that owns all the bytes
//! it owns, according to the size reported by its header. Using this type
//! and with the help of [`MaybeDynSized`], we can call
//! [`DynSizedStructure::cast`] to cast this to arbitrary sized or unsized
//! struct types fulfilling the corresponding requirements.
//!
//! This way, one can create nice rusty structs modeling the structure of the
//! tags, and we only need a single "complicated" type, namely
//! [`DynSizedStructure`].
//!
//! ## Iterating Tags
//!
//! To iterate over the tags of a structure, use [`TagIter`].
//!
//! # Memory Guarantees and Safety Promises
//!
//! For the parsing and construction of Multiboot2 structures, the alignment
//! and necessary padding bytes as discussed above are guaranteed. When types
//! are constructed, they return Results with appropriate error types. If
//! during runtime something goes wrong, for example due to malformed tags,
//! panics guarantee that no UB will happen.
//!
//! # No Public API
//!
//! Not meant as stable public API for others outside Multiboot2.
